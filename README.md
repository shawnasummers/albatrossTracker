# albatrossTracker

This web application uses the data provided by MoveBank to track one albatross' path over a short period of time.  Utilizing both MoveBank API and MapBox API you can see the path the albatross takes on a map with a marker that will move with the albatross' location.  This is not in real time.  This has a static set of JSON data that it pulls from.
